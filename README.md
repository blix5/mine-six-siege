# Not Tom Clancy's Mine Six Siege
A recreation of some of the mechanics and weapons from Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege in Minecraft. 

> **What is Rainbow Six Siege?**

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, released in 2015, is a tactical 5v5 first-person shooter. There is an attack and defense, along with several maps and operators to choose from. Each round is 3 minutes, and attackers must enter the building and complete their assigned objective or take out all 5 of the enemy defenders, while the defenders must defend their objective. The objective is determined by the game mode, the 3 of which are Bomb, Hostage, and Secure Area, with Bomb being the most commonly played. However, besides the tactics and strategy required for Siege, one of the most unique things about Siege is its gunplay, which features abnormally fast and realistic TTKs (time to kill), one-shot headshot, perfect-accuracy guns, and leaning mechanics, all of which make the game incredibly challenging, especially for beginners. 

> **What does this mod plan to add?**

I don't plan on committing heavily to this mod, so don't expect every weapon from Siege to be added to this mod, just *maybe* a few basic weapons, barricades, and some mechanics, such as leaning, shooting (obviously), reloading, etc. I don't have specific plans for what I'll add to this mod, but I have a Github page below for anyone who wants to use the resources for their own purposes.

I hope to add gadgets such as frag grenades and possibly nitro cells in the future, as well as at least one defender weapon, such as the MP5K, along with Recruit's primary and secondary weapons on attack and defense, which could possibly make a playable Siege round in Minecraft. 

**Current Features:**

Primary Weapons:
- L85A2

Secondary Weapons: (none)

Misc:
- Knife
- Barricades
